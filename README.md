### Galaxy (https://galaxyproject.org) theme derived from bootstrap.

Example site served at http://jxtx.github.io/galaxy-bootstrap/

`galaxy_bootstrap` contains a `variables.less` that has been modified to remove almost all hardcoded colors. A small number of variables define primary color, border color, and how to derive other colors from them. 

To build:

`yarn run build`

Which will build regular and minified css files into dist.

index.html is a sample stolen from Bootswatch that shows most things.
